# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Building and Deploying Java Web Applications with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Tomcat, and Docker

Automate the build and deployment of your Java web applications with this Jenkins pipeline. This robust CI/CD solution leverages Docker as an agent for streamlined, consistent, and efficient deployment to an Apache Tomcat server.
This Jenkins pipeline automates the build and deployment process for a Java web application to an Apache Tomcat server. It utilizes Docker containers for isolation and is triggered by GitHub pushes to the main branch.

## Overview

This Jenkins pipeline simplifies and accelerates the deployment of Java web applications to an Apache Tomcat server. The pipeline automates various stages, including building, testing, archiving, and deploying your applications with precision and reliability. It's designed to seamlessly integrate with your GitHub repository, triggering automated builds on every push to the main branch.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this pipeline, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Jenkins Server**: Set up a Jenkins server with the necessary plugins, including GitHub Integration, Docker Pipeline (for Docker containerization), Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin, and SSH Agent Plugin.
- **Tomcat Server**: Have access to an Apache Tomcat server where your WAR files will be deployed.
- **Docker Environment**: Ensure that Docker is installed and configured on your Jenkins server. Mount the Docker socket for container access.
- **GitHub Repository**: Host your Java web application in a GitHub repository.

## Pipeline Stages

The Jenkins pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Git Checkout**:
   - The pipeline checks out the source code from the specified GitHub repository.

2. **CodeBuild**:
   - Maven is used to build the Java application, performing a clean build and packaging it into a WAR file.

3. **JUnit Report**:
   - The pipeline runs JUnit tests on the code and generates detailed test reports.

4. **Archive Artifact**:
   - The generated WAR file is archived, making it accessible for future reference and deployment.

5. **Deploy WAR to Tomcat**:
   - The pipeline deploys the WAR file to an Apache Tomcat server using SSH and SCP, ensuring a seamless deployment process.

## Usage

To use this pipeline effectively:

1. **GitHub Configuration**:
   - Configure webhook integration in your GitHub repository to automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline on pushes to the main branch.

2. **Jenkins Configuration**:
   - Configure Jenkins to utilize the Docker image 'abhishekf5/maven-abhishek-docker-agent:v1' for pipeline execution.
   - Mount the Docker socket using the `--user root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` argument to grant Docker access.

3. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - Simply push code changes to the main branch of your GitHub repository. Jenkins will automatically execute the pipeline stages on each push event, ensuring a seamless and automated deployment process.

## Customization

- You have the flexibility to customize the Docker image used in the agent section to match the specific requirements of your projects.
- Modify URLs, paths, and settings within the pipeline stages to tailor the pipeline to your unique project needs.
